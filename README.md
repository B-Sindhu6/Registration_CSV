# Registration_CSV
A simple web application which save/read a CSV to do registrations

Code is written in Python 3x
Need to install flask module in python before using it

The .html files should be placed in templates folder in same directory as the .py file

If filename.csv is not getting updated after running the program, try mentioning the complete path of CSV file
